This project is a simple social media app developed as part of the Software Development and Mobile Systems course at LETI - ISEP.

It was created in a team of two with the goal of learning how to build cross-platform mobile applications using modern development practices.

ðŸ’¡ Note: The project was initially hosted on a university account. After completion, it was migrated to this personal repository â€” hence the single commit history.
